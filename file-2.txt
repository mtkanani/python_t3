Spider webs have existed for at least 100 million years, as witnessed in a rare find of Early Cretaceous amber from Sussex, in southern 
England.[2] Many spiders build webs specifically to trap and catch insects to eat. However, not all spiders catch their prey in webs, and
some do not build webs at all. The term "spider web" is typically used to refer to a web that is apparently still in use (i.e., clean), 
whereas "cobweb" refers to a seemingly abandoned (i.e., dusty) web.[3] However, the word "cobweb" is also used by biologists to describe the
tangled three-dimensional web[4] of some spiders of the family Theridiidae. While this large family is known as the cobweb spiders, they 
actually have a huge range of web architectures; other names for this spider family include tangle-web spiders and comb-footed spiders.

When spiders moved from the water to the land in the Early Devonian period, they started making silk to protect their bodies a
theireggs.Most Spiders have appendages called spinnerets. These are organs that produce silk with which the spiders spin webs (although som
use the silk to catch their prey in other ways). [3][5] Spiders gradually started using silk for hunting purposes, first as guide lines 
andsignal lines, then as ground or bush webs, and eventually as the aerial webs that are familiar today.[6]
Spiders produce silk from their spinneret glands located at the tip of their abdomen. Each gland produces a thread for a special purpose 
for example a trailed safety line, sticky silk for trapping prey or fine silk for wrapping it. Spiders use different gland types to produce different silks, and some spiders are capable of producing up to eight different silks during their lifetime.[7]
Most spiders have three pairs of spinnerets, each having its own function – there are also spiders with just one pair and others with as many as four pairs.
Webs allow a spider to catch prey without having to expend energy by running it down, making it an efficient method of gathering food.The 
hair and claws on spiders' legs allow them to cling to their webs. The oils on their bodies keep them from sticking to their own webs. 
However these energy savings are somewhat offset by the fact that constructing the web is in itself energetically costly, due to the large 
amount of protein required in the form of silk. In addition, after a time the silk will lose its stickiness and thus become inefficient at 
capturing prey. It is common for spiders to eat their own web daily to recoup some of the energy used in spinning. Through ingestion and 
digestion, the silk proteins are thus recycled.Due to the incredible strength of spider silk, scientists are currently studying it in the 
hope of creating a super-tough material with the same abilities.
